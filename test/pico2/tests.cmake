# What this board's tests need.
#
# The board carries source sets that are NOT compiled into every application --
# see test/boards/pico2/board.cmake for why. This file says which test takes
# which, and it is a transcription of the predecessor's Makefiles, not a new
# arrangement:
#
#   every test    the board's uart.cpp and its RTOS glue
#   smp-test5     the glue only -- it defines its own uart:: in main.cpp
#   the SMP tests multicore.cpp, the bootrom core-1 launch
#   smp-test1     no multicore.cpp: it is the single-core RTOS bring-up
#   sc-test-ko    no multicore.cpp: the single-core kernel-object test
#   the USB pair  TinyUSB -- the core, one class driver, and their own
#                 tusb_config.h, which is why their include directory goes
#                 first
#   the CDC test  ws2812.cpp as well: its console is the USB, so it reports
#                 with the RGB LED
#
# smp-test1 and sc-test-ko are also the two tests that run at OS_NCPU=1 on a
# two-core board. That is not a simplification: sc-test-ko is the only test on
# this silicon that exercises the kernel's non-SMP branch, which is what makes
# it worth keeping beside its SMP twin.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

set (_single_core smp-test1 sc-test-ko)

# The two applications that compile NO KERNEL. They are the bare-metal probes
# that run before a scheduler exists: smp-test0 starts the second core itself
# and checks the two can talk, exc-test asks whether exception ENTRY works at
# all. Their Makefiles list no kernel source and no port core -- nine files
# and seven files respectively -- so they link the port's bare target.
